Rob writes. my cousin Dennis was someone I looked up to as a model outdoorsman. We did a trip together, in my brand new aluminum canoe, about 1971, starting at the cabin at Panache and portaging into the many lakes of Killarney Provincial Park to the south, before anyone knew it existed. He shattered my image of him as a great outdoorsman after he built a campfire in the base of a tree and later that night we woke up to the tree burning. Luckily it was close to the lake and we jumped in and splashed the tree until the fire was out.

Our family name was Maksymowicz before grandma changed it to Macks to deal with discrimination and pronunciation. Our cousin says the "Mak or Mac" part of our name indicates Viking origin. They were everywhere. My understanding is that the "son of" ending of the name is "vitch" in Russian, "wicz" Ukrainian, and "witz" Jewish. All pronounced like vitch.  
SON OF A VITCH!

Jon Mack's DNA test found more DNA from the local area (87% Eastern Europeans) than the average Russian/Polish person's, which is 59% Eastern European. So we're original gangstas - yet he has only 1.1% Neanderthal. 

Jon is also 6% Finland/Siberia, 4% Jewish Diaspora, and 3% Central Asia. In contrast, the average polish person is 5% Finland/Siberia, 6% Jewish Diaspora, and 3% Central Asia, plus the average Polish person has four other ancestries my uncle didn't have: 13% Western/Central European (Germanic), 7% Southern European and 5% Asia Minor (both incoming agricultural migrations), and 2% Scandinavian. So did we live deep in the hills and forests of Eastern Europe (Ukrainian and Poland), away from the wandering influxes?  

When the family migrated to Sudbury in Ontario, Canada, they sold supplies to lumberjacks by hiking into remote areas.  Later they would build 7+ cabins around Lake Panache by hauling supplies in over the ice in the winter.
