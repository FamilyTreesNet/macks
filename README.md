# Maksymowicz - Macks

Parents of Eugene, Paul, Rhodie and Helen.

Eugene Macks migrated from Canada to Detroit and sired Gene, Vivian, Jonathan and Robert.  

Rhodie married Anne. Their kids: [Dennis Macks](https://lougheedfuneralhomes.com/book-of-memories/2019988/macks-dennis/obituary.php) and Sonya (Macks) Matichuk.

Our family name was Maksymowicz before grandma changed it to Macks to deal with discrimination and pronunciation. Our cousin says the "Mak or Mac" part of our name indicates Viking origin. They were everywhere. My understanding is that the "son of" ending of the name is "vitch" in Russian, "wicz" Ukrainian, and "witz" Jewish. All pronounced like vitch.  
SON OF A VITCH!
&ndash; From Rob Macks, [Laughing Loon](https://laughingloon.com)  

Jon Mack's DNA test found more DNA from the local area (87% Eastern Europeans) than the average Russian/Polish person's, which is 59% Eastern European. So we're original gangstas - yet he has only 1.1% Neanderthal. 

Jon is also 6% Finland/Siberia, 4% Jewish Diaspora, and 3% Central Asia. In contrast, the average polish person is 5% Finland/Siberia, 6% Jewish Diaspora, and 3% Central Asia, plus the average Polish person has four other ancestries my uncle didn't have: 13% Western/Central European (Germanic), 7% Southern European and 5% Asia Minor (both incoming agricultural migrations), and 2% Scandinavian. So did we live deep in the hills and forests of Eastern Europe (Ukrainian and Poland), away from the wandering influxes?  

When the family migrated to Sudbury Canada, they sold supplies to lumberjacks by hiking into remote areas.  Later they would build 7+ cabins around Lake Panache by hauling supplies in over the ice in the winter.
