Jonathan Macks - With more Eastern European (87%) ancestry than the average Russian/Polish person (59%), seems like our ancestors probably didn't live near migration routes. Even Jon's 4% Jewish Diaspora is less than the average of 6% for the region. More Finish/Siberian (6%) than Central Asian (3%).
